## L'Etiopia

Produced in 1935 by the Confederazione Fascista dei Lavoratori dell'Agricolutura, *L'Etiopia* stated aim is to serve as a starting point to the general knowledge of the Ethiopian Empire. Ninety-three pages dedicated to agriculture, the work provides a curious artifact that shows the Italian Fascists resolve to exploit Ethiopian agricultural resources for financial gain. 

> “An honest and disinterested relationship on the things of that territory [Ethiopia] that the resolute will of Fascist Italy, strong of its good laws , day by day, approaches our sensibilities.”
