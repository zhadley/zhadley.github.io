I am a PhD Candidate at the American Graduate School in Paris in the field of International Relations. I have almost a decade of experience working with the U.S. government, African regional institutions, and member states. My primary research interests include  a focus on contemporary African security issues, the Global Power Competition, and violent extremist ideologies.

I recently graduated from Harvard University Extension School with a masters in international relations. Iworked as a research assistant at the John F. Kennedy School of Government from 2017-2018. I earned a B.A. in Political Science (Honors) from the University of Central Florida and also served as a US Army Captain (Ret.) from 2005-2010. 

My thesis research, _"African Spaghetti Bowl: Assessing State Rationales in African Peacekeeping Operations, 1999-2016,"_ explored the key factors behind African state support for United Nations peacekeeping on the continent. It won the 2019 HES Dean's Thesis Prize in International Relations. [Find it here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hadley/files/african_spaghetti_bowl_hadley.pdf).
