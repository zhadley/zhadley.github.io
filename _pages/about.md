I am a PhD Candidate at the American Graduate School in Paris in the field of International Relations. I have almost a decade of experience working with the US government, African regional institutions, and member states. My primary interests include African security issues, great powers competition, and extremist political ideologies.

In 2019, I graduated from Harvard University with an ALM in IR and worked as a research assistant at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. I received a BA in Political Science from the University of Central Florida and served as a US Army Captain (Ret.) from 2005-2010. I am a member of the American Political Science Association (APSA), International Political Science Association (IPSA), and the Harvard Club of France.
