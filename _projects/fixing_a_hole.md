Working Paper

In the twenty-first century, complex and dynamic challenges within Africa are borderless. With the ability to scale exponentially, localized conflicts can quickly destabilize regions. Since the early aughts, scholarly efforts to explicate transnational challenges has led to a growing body of literature dedicated to the African continent. While promising, the corpora of secondary literatures often lack conceptual rigor and depth --- requiring students, researchers and policy-makers to thread coherent narratives across diverse sets of government records, media reports, and firsthand accounts. 

_Contemporary Security Issues in Africa_ by William A. Taylor attempts to fill this void by serving as a primer for students, scholars, policy-makers, and general readers on Sub-Saharan Africa. Spanning three decades across sixteen case studies, the work aims to 

> "Explore the nexus of culture, politics, and security at the national, regional and international level."

The author contends that this is necessary to parse out the roots of the continent’s growing relevance in global affairs. To accomplish this goal --- in a neat two-hundred-and-forty-one page volume --- requires a Herculean effort.

Within a framework of eight broad categories, the case studies explore state fragility, ethno-religious conflict, food insecurity, violent extremism, maritime piracy and extreme poverty as the primary drivers of regional insecurity. Methodologically, the research design is constrained by the lack of a structured case comparison. As a result, the work does not clearly advance a central thesis. A disciplined case selection would anchor evidence to the implicit assumption that addressing Africa’s transnational threats are crucial to international security. 

Absent a conceptual model, readers must infer regional implications from myriad facts, figures and timelines. We must assume that the evidence presented is most relevant to the cases at hand. Unfortunately, the results do not support a generalizable set of necessary conditions valid across contingent cases. Emerging transnational threats require new modes of thinking --- focused on the ability of the African Union, regional economic communities and member states to circumvent pitfalls on the path to cooperation[^2]. 

## Categorical Imperatives: Defining Transnational Security

Since Aristotle’s _Organon_, humankind has systematized observable phenomena in order to make sense of the physical world. To accomplish this task, we employ concepts --- tools to apprehend the world around us. Facts distilled through concepts provide meaning. To define transnationalism, we must categorize its features. In a literal sense, transnational threats emerge in one territory and spill over into another. However, insecurity is not always attributable to proximity alone. Technological advancements provide new pathways to contagion across multiple spheres including cyber security, financial, business and environmental sectors. Domestic threats can emerge from outside immediate regions --- it is worth considering the role of global institutions, foreign states and non-state actors to enable domestic instability.

Recognizing that a degree of simplification is always necessary, any research project must address the key question of measure validity. Broad categorization can obscure meaningful distinctions across cases. Unfortunately, the work provides no rationale for grouping the case studies into these categories. A canvas of relevant literature highlights tenuous political alliances, ethno-religious violence, weak institutions, and socio-economic factors.  Domestic, regional, and geopolitical dimensions are equally plausible. Yet, the work leaves competing explanations unreconciled.  

## The Case Studies

The introductory cases explore "ungoverned spaces" within the Central African Republic and Mali as primary drivers of insecurity. Defined as 

> "…the absence of central government control over a region and its people and challenges to the state’s authority by one or more groups" (Location 687).

The concept of ungoverned spaces provides a thread traceable throughout subsequent chapters.  State fragility is a source from which "neighborhood effects" flow.  Yet, a survey of relevant literature reveals a lack of consensus on the definition --- making measurement problematic. Political violence and a lack of basic services are two common features of fragile states.[^3] In the absence of credible institutions, ungoverned spaces become sanctuaries for transnational threats. Economic development, credible security and political stability are essential to asserting state authority.[^4] Yet, the first case studies frame instability in terms of political corruption only. 

Mali was heralded a democratic success story following the overthrow of the Traoré regime in 1991. It would become the recipient of significant amounts of foreign aid and investment. During the early aughts, Mali received an estimated $1.8 billion dollars in U.S. foreign aid alone. In 2012, Mali experienced a renewed Tuareg rebellion in northern Azawad and a military coup in the capital of Bamako. By 2013, a growing insurgency fueled by elements of Al-Qaeda in Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar Dine effectively controlled its remote northern regions. Compare Mali and the Central African Republic's corruption score to their regional neighbors.

Clearly, corruption alone cannot account for the dramatic reversal in Mali's fortunes. Equally plausible, a vicious circle of poor governance, moribund economies, and under-resourced security forces were key factors in undermining security across the Sahel region. The focus on corruption belies the multiple challenges facing Mali and the Central African Republic. Although corruption can undermine public trust in domestic institutions and fracture national unity, greater context is required. 

A discussion of growing Russian involvement in the region is a missed opportunity to anchor regional challenges to international security. At the recent 2019 Russia-Africa Summit, Central African President Faustin-Archange Touadéra requested the Russia government to "intervene" by overturning international arms embargos on the Central African Republic. Between 2014 and 2018, Africa received 17 percent of all major Russian weapon exports --- second only to Asia. Evidence of private military contractors across Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates a significant renewal of Russian strategic interests in the region. Russia will seek to leverage its economic and political ties in the absence of sustained Western engagement. 

The United States must encourage good governance and accountability while strengthening regional security institutions. Sub-Saharan Africa represents one of the few regions where new opportunities for partnerships and cooperation are still possible. At the same time, the United States must find ways to impose costs on its near-peer competitors while mitigating collateral damage to its African partners. The balancing act will become a defining challenge for the United States during the next global power competition. Relationships matter. 

## Socio-Economic Challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa

A case study on the Lord’s Resistance Army highlights the ethno-religious dimension to security. What began as a Ugandan rebel group in the 1990s, soon metastasized into a violent extremist organization responsible for widespread human rights violations throughout the Great Lakes region.[^5] Curiously, however, the case studies do not anchor ethno-religious conflict to the early discussion of corruption and state fragility. Examples abound where political leaders have exploited the patchwork of ethnic and religious tensions for ballot-box advantages with predictably violent outcomes. The complex interplay of such forces within the region provides fertile ground for insecurity.

The work turns towards a discussion of the “resource curse” theory, which argues that developing states with significant natural resources are often plagued by instability and corruption. In particular, the work highlights predatory lending and resource extraction in Angola. As foreign direct investment lags, China’s willingness to provide loans and investment has proven difficult for many African states to resist. However, the growing perception that such deals represent significant debt traps for African states may present an opportunity for investment alternatives. The United States can display the flag without the uniform.

Piracy in the Horn of Africa has led to increased maritime cooperation between the African Union, regional economic communities, and international partners. It provides an example of successful regional collaboration and cooperation where the economic interests of member-states intersect. China's strategic interests in the Gulf of Aden led to the establishment of its first naval base in Djibouti in 2017. As an entry point to East Africa, the base supports China's power projection and soft power diplomacy goals.[^6] 

Case studies on Ethiopia and Malawi explore linkages between food insecurity, poverty and conflict. Malawi faces many of the same challenges as Ethiopia. Its population growth rate is double that of its food production, requiring significant amounts of food importation. Malawi's urban-rural divide further affects economic development due to the lack of infrastructure, basic social services and employment opportunities in many rural communities.[^7] Although Malawi has experienced gradual economic growth since the early aughts, all citizens do not equally share in the benefits. 

[Fig. 2 Food Insecurity vs. Extreme Poverty vs. Conflict]

Figure 2 highlights the relationship between food insecurity and extreme poverty on conflict. [Explicate the results]. 

The colinearity of socio-economic factors makes it difficult to parse out the relative impact of each factor on insecurity. Are these challenges specific to the case studies or contingent given a set of sufficient conditions? More substantively, how should policy-makers allocate limited resources to address strategic priorities facing the African continent? 

## Implications for International Security

The final chapters highlight geopolitical implications for Africa in terms of the emerging multipolar system. The work contends that U.S. strategic interests grew in earnest upon the creation of U.S. Africa Command in 2007.  

> "The United States has amplified relations with Africa over the past three decades, most visibly with the creation in 2007 of U.S. Africa Command" (Location 2820). 

However, framing U.S. strategic interests in terms of security cooperation provides an incomplete picture. For example, the United States foreign assistance programs continue to significantly overshadow its military aid. Interagency has provided robust support to development within Africa with programs at the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Agriculture and United States Agency for Interational Development. 


[Figure 3. Levels of U.S. Foreign and Military Aid since 1999]


The work acknowledges critics who argue that U.S. Africa Command has militarized U.S. foreign policy in Africa. In particular, "phase zero" operations risk duplicating the roles and responsibilities of the U.S. interagency, non-governmental organizations and donor nations. However, the work does not provide evidence to support this contention. As a counterpoint, it highlights Chinese involvement in terms of its economic interests. 

> China-Africa relations are "one of the most critical developments in international affairs" during the past decade (Location 2948). 

However, economic cooperation  has varied according to changing conditions in Africa and China during the past three decades. Seeking to address a growing trade deficit, China balances its resource extraction with export of surplus labor and commodities. Business first and politics _later_ still holds mostly true for Chinese engagement with Africa. It remains unclear if its strategic goal to upend the existing international order will find broad African support. Chinese financial and economic linkages will force compromises on its preference for ideological neutrality within Africa, where it is business first and politics always. 

The de-emphasis of African state actors in bi-lateral engagements portrays African states as passive in nature --- at worst, exploited (Location 3152).  African leaders clearly understand the risks and rewards of engagement in a new Great Power competition. As observed during the Cold War, African states will seek to maximize their benefits while hedging against losses. Shocks to the international order will reverberate across African capitals. 

Notably absent from the preceding canvas is a discussion of the roles of the regional economic communities, the African Union, and United Nations. In 2016, the African Union published it African Peace and Security Architecture Roadmap. It was the first attempt by the AU to define a strategic vision for addressing Africa’s peace and security challenges. It provides measurable objectives to meet its ambitious targets laid out in Agenda 2063 and Silence the Guns 2020. Likewise, regional efforts to address insecurity have led to recent deployments in Mali (AFISMA), the Central African Republic (MICOPAX), and Somalia (AMISOM). The United Nations currently maintains peacekeepers in seven missions across the continent. 

## Fixing a Hole: Final Thoughts

The work offers a broad overview on current African security challenges. Yet, in attempting to supply the needs of most, it appears useful to few. Presented a compendium of facts without the necessary conceptual tools, make it difficult to assess implications. Again, this is not without value, but the work’s intended market remains unclear. Strategy and policy-oriented readership appetites will remain insatiate. A casual reader in the market for a one-source of facts, figures and timelines may benefit. However, the hardcover price makes this hard to justify. Facts without concepts inform little. 

The work correctly identifies many factors of Africa’s endemic instability. However, the tacit assumption that the symptoms are causal leaves the substratum of political, socio-economic, and institutional exclusions intact. The reality is more complicated. A transnational security model that assesses facts through economic, political, security, institutional, and normative rationales can untangle such complexities.  

U.S foreign policy requires a holistic whole-of-government approach focused on peace, governance, and security. Where there are challenges, there are opportunities. Regional and business-sector partnerships that leverage comparative advantages limit duplication of efforts. Targeted funding and foreign aid will support the implementation of the African Union's strategic security objectives. Organizational improvements focused on policy harmonization and subsidiarity at the state, regional and institutional levels provide purpose and direction. “African solutions to African problems” are achievable, if at present, aspirational.
