Working Paper

In the twenty-first century, complex and dynamic challenges within Africa are borderless. With the ability to scale exponentially, localized conflicts can quickly destabilize regions. Since the early aughts, scholarly efforts to explicate transnational challenges has led to a growing body of literature dedicated to the African continent. While promising, the corpora of secondary literature often lack conceptual rigor and depth --- requiring students, researchers and policy-makers to thread coherent narratives across diverse sets of government records, media reports, and written accounts. 

_Contemporary Security Issues in Africa_ by William A. Taylor attempts to fill this void by serving as a primer for students, scholars, policy-makers, and general readers on Sub-Saharan Africa. Spanning three decades across sixteen case studies, the work aims to 

> "Explore the nexus of culture, politics, and security at the national, regional and international level."

The author contends that this is necessary to parse out the roots of the continent’s growing relevance in global affairs. To accomplish this goal --- in a neat two-hundred-and-forty-one page volume --- requires a Herculean effort.

Within a framework of eight broad categories, the case studies explore state fragility, ethno-religious conflict, food insecurity, violent extremism, maritime piracy and extreme poverty as the primary drivers of regional insecurity. Methodologically, the research design is constrained by the lack of a structured case comparison. As a result, the work does not clearly advance a central thesis. A disciplined case selection would more firmly anchor the evidence to an assumption that addressing Africa’s transnational threats are crucial to international security. 

Absent a conceptual model, readers must infer regional implications from myriad facts, figures and timelines. We must assume that the evidence presented is most relevant to the cases at hand. Unfortunately, the results do not support a generalizable set of necessary conditions valid across contingent cases. Emerging transnational threats require new modes of thinking --- focused on the ability of the African Union, regional economic communities and member states to circumvent pitfalls on the path towards cooperation. 

## Categorical Imperatives: Defining Transnational Security

Since Aristotle’s _Organon_, humankind has systematized observable phenomena in order to make sense of the physical world. To accomplish this task, we employ concepts --- tools to apprehend the world around us. Facts distilled through concepts provide meaning. To define transnationalism, we must categorize its features. In a literal sense, transnational threats emerge in one territory and spill over into another. However, insecurity is not always attributable to proximity alone. Technological advancements provide new pathways to contagion across multiple spheres including cyber security, financial, business and environmental sectors. Domestic threats can emerge from outside immediate regions --- it is worth considering the role of global institutions, foreign states and non-state actors to enable domestic instability.

Recognizing that simplification is always required, any research project must address the key question of measure validity. Broad categorization can obscure meaningful distinctions across cases. Unfortunately, the work provides no rationale for grouping the case studies into these categories. The African Union situates transnational threats within the context of broader strategic security. A canvas of relevant literature highlights tenuous political alliances, ethno-religious violence, weak institutions, and socio-economic factors.  Domestic, regional, and geopolitical dimensions are equally plausible. Yet, the work leaves competing explanations unreconciled.  

## The Case Studies

The introductory cases explore "ungoverned spaces" within the Central African Republic and Mali as primary drivers of insecurity. Defined as 

> "…the absence of central government control over a region and its people and challenges to the state’s authority by one or more groups" (Location 687).

The concept of ungoverned spaces provides a thread traceable throughout subsequent chapters.  State fragility is a source from which "neighborhood effects" flow.  Yet, a survey of relevant literature reveals a lack of consensus on the definition --- making measurement problematic. Political violence and a lack of basic services are two common features of fragile states.  In the absence of stable institutions, ungoverned spaces become sanctuaries for transnational threats. Development, security and stability are essential to asserting state authority.  The work appears to overemphasize corruption as the key impediment to political stability. A comparison of Central African Republic and Malian political corruption against state fragility suggests a weak correlation.  

[Figure 1. Corruption vs. state fragility]

Mali provides a corollary to the corrosive effect of corruption on political institutions. Mali was heralded a democratic success story following the overthrow of the Traoré regime in 1991. It would become the recipient of significant amounts of foreign aid and investment. Between 1999 and 2013, Mali received an estimated 1.8 billion USD in U.S. foreign aid alone. Yet, by 2013 it had experienced a Taureg rebellion in the Azawad, a military coup in Bamako, and renewed violent extremism across its porous Sahel borders. Clearly, corruption alone cannot account for the dramatic reversal in Mali's fortune. Compare Mali's corruption score to its regional neighbors. 

[Table 1: Comparision of Corruption Index]

Equally plausible, a vicious circle of poor governance, moribund economies, and weak security institutions have fostered greater levels of regional insecurity. The focus on corruption belies the multiple challenges facing the Central African Republic (CAR). The picture thus provided remains incomplete. 

A discussion of growing Russian involvement in central Africa is a missed opportunity to anchor regional challenges to international security. At the 2019 Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi, Central African President Faustin-Archange Toudera requested that Russia "intervene" to overturn international embargos limiting arms sales to the country. Between 2014 and 2018, Africa received 17 percent of all major Russian weapon exports --- second only to Asia. Evidence of private military contractors across Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates a significant renewal of Russian strategic interests in the region. Within Sub-Saharan Africa, military cooperation precedes political cooperation. Russia will seek to exploit its leverage in the absence of sustained Western engagement. 

The United States must find ways to encourage good governance and transparency while strengthening CAR's security institutions. With geopolitical stasis taking hold across much of Europe and Asia, sub-Saharan Africa represents one of the last regions where new opportunities for partnerships and cooperation is possible. At the same time, the United States must find ways to impose costs on its near-peer competitors without fostering blow-back on its African partners. That balancing act will become a defining challenge for the United States in the Global Power Competition. 


## Socio-Economic Challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa

The discussion shifts towards socio-economic factors with a chronology of ethno-religious conflict in Uganda and Sudan. A case study on the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) purports to explore the religious dimension of conflict in Great Lakes region. The LRA began as an armed rebel group in the 1990s before metastasizing into a terrorist organization by the early aughts responsible for widespread human rights violations. Arguably, the cult of personality surrounding LRA leader, Joseph Kony, best represents its quasi-religious undertones. However, the length to which LRA adequately highlights ethno-religious dimensions to conflict is questionable. Multiple attempts to explicate the durability of the group lend required nuance. 

Curiously, the case studies do not frame the ethno-religious dimension in terms of state fragility. The complex interplay of socio-economic and political forces found in the Great Lakes region provides fertile ground for ethno-religious and civil conflict. The substratum of this dynamic is exclusion among rival ethnic groups. Is this dimension unique to the Great Lakes region or are fragile states more prone to experience ethno-religious conflict? 

The focus turns towards a discussion of the “resource curse” theory. It argues that developing states with significant levels of natural resources are often subject to political instability and corruption in form of rent seeking. In particular, the work highlights Chinese predatory lending practices and resource extraction in Angola. Critics cite the lending practices as exploitative causing significant deficits. As foreign aid remains moribund, Chinese willingness to engage in lending and investment has proven difficult for many states to resist. Viewed in terms of the Great Power Competition, the U.S. can leverage its foreign aid, humanitarian assistance programs, and private sector resources to counter Chinese influence on the continent. The U.S. can display the flag without the uniform.

A chapter is dedicated to exploring the maritime security within Africa. Piracy in the Horn of Africa led to increased cooperation between the African Union, regional economic communities (REC) and international partners. It provides an example of successful regional and international security cooperation where economic interests intersect. Counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Guinea demonstrate similar resolve. Chinese strategic interests led the first deployment of Chinese naval assets to combat piracy in East Africa and establishment of a naval base in Djibouti in 2017. 

Turning to food insecurity and extreme poverty, case studies on Ethiopia and Malawi explore linkages to conflict. Malawi faces many of the same challenges as Ethiopia. Its rate of population growth is double that of its food production, requiring to importation. Its urban-rural divide hampers economic development due to the lack of infrastructure, basic social services and employment opportunities in many rural communities.  Although Malawi has experienced gradual economic growth since the early aughts, all do not equally share the benefits. 

[Fig. 2 Food Insecurity vs. Extreme Poverty vs. Conflict]

Figure 2 highlights the relationship between food insecurity and extreme poverty on conflict. [Explicate the results]. 

The interconnectedness of socio-economic factors makes it difficult to parse out the relative impact of each factor on conflict. Are these challenges specific to the case studies or contingent given a set of necessary and sufficient conditions? More substantively, how should policy-makers prioritize scarce resources in terms of most pressing challenges facing the African continent?

## Implications for International Security

The final chapters highlight geopolitical implications for Africa in terms of growing U.S. and Chinese involvement during the past three decades. The work contends that U.S. interests began in earnest after the creation of U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) in 2007. As a result, the work portrays U.S. engagement as distinctly different from China’s economic approach. 

> "The United States has amplified relations with Africa over the past three decades, most visibly with the creation in 2007 of U.S. Africa Command" (Location 2820). 

However, portrayal of U.S. national interests in terms of its military engagements provides an incomplete picture. A more nuanced approach would show that other forms of U.S. foreign aid significantly dwarf its military aid. Moreover, aid levels to Africa have remained relatively unchanged since the 1990s. U.S. foreign military aid accounts for just 5.6 billion dollars during the past decade.


[Figure 3. Levels of U.S. Foreign and Military Aid since 1990]


The work acknowledges critical arguments that USAFRICOM has militarized U.S. foreign policy in Africa. In particular, the focus on "phase zero" operations risk duplicating the roles and responsibilities of the U.S. interagency, non-governmental organizations and donor nations. However, the work does not provide evidence to support this contention. As a counterpoint, it highlights Chinese involvement in terms of its economic interests. 

> China-Africa relations are "one of the most critical developments in international affairs" during the past decade (Location 2948). 

However, growth is not linear --- but has varied according to changing conditions in Africa and China during the past three decades. Seeking to address a growing trade deficit, China balances its resource extraction with export of surplus labor and commodities. Business first and politics _later_ still holds mostly true for Chinese engagement with Africa. It remains unclear if its strategic goal to upend the existing international order will find broad African support. Chinese financial and economic linkages will force compromises on its preference for ideological neutrality within Africa, where it is business first and politics always. 

The de-emphasis of African state actors in bi-lateral engagements portrays African states as passive in nature --- at worst, exploited (Location 3152).  African leaders clearly understand the risks and rewards of engagement in a new Great Power competition. As observed during the Cold War, African states will seek to maximize their benefits while hedging against losses. Shocks to the international order will reverberate across African capitals. 

Notably absent from the preceding canvas is a discussion of the roles of the regional economic communities, the African Union, and United Nations. In 2016, the African Union published it African Peace and Security Architecture Roadmap. It was the first attempt by the AU to define a strategic vision for addressing Africa’s peace and security challenges. It provides measurable objectives to meet its ambitious targets laid out in Agenda 2063 and Silence the Guns 2020. Likewise, regional efforts to address insecurity have led to recent deployments in Mali (AFISMA), Central African Republic (MICOPAX), and Somalia (AMISOM). The United Nations currently maintains peacekeepers in seven missions across the continent. 

## Fixing a Hole: Final Thoughts

The work offers a broad overview on current African security challenges. Yet, in attempting to supply the needs of most, it appears useful to few. Presented a compendium of facts without the necessary conceptual tools, make it difficult to assess implications. Again, this is not without value, but the work’s intended market remains unclear. Strategy and policy-oriented readership appetites will remain insatiate. A casual reader in the market for a one-source of facts, figures and timelines may benefit. However, the hardcover price makes this hard to justify. Facts without concepts inform little. 

The work correctly identifies many factors of Africa’s endemic instability. However, the tacit assumption that the symptoms are causal  leaves the substratum of political, socio-economic, and institutional exclusions intact. The reality is more complicated. A transnational security model that assesses facts through economic, political, security, institutional, and normative rationales can untangle such complexities.  

U.S foreign policy requires a holistic whole-of-government approach focused on peace, governance, and security. Where there are challenges, there are opportunities. Regional and business-sector partnerships that leverage comparative advantages limit duplication of efforts. Targeted funding and foreign aid will support the implementation of the African Union's strategic security objectives. Organizational improvements focused on policy harmonization and subsidiarity at the state, regional and institutional levels provide purpose and direction. “African solutions to African problems” are achievable, if at present, aspirational.
