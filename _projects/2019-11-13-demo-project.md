## A Critical Essay 

In the twenty-first century, complex and dynamic challenges within Africa including violent extremism, illicit trafficking, and climate change are borderless. With the ability to scale exponentially, localized conflicts destabilize regions. Since the early aughts, scholarly efforts to explicate transnational challenges has led to a growing body of literature dedicated to the African continent. While promising, the corpora of secondary literature often lack conceptual rigor and depth -- requiring students, researchers and policy-makers to thread coherent narratives across diverse sets of government records, media reports, and scholarly research. 

\textit{Contemporary Security Issues in Africa} by William A. Taylor attempts to fill this void by serving as a primer for students, scholars, policy-makers, and general readers on Sub-Saharan Africa. Spanning three decades across sixteen case studies, the work aims to 


> “Explore the nexus of culture, politics, and security at the national, regional and international level.”

The author contends that this is necessary to parse out the roots of the continent’s growing relevance in global affairs. To accomplish this goal -- in a two-hundred-and-forty-one page volume -- requires a Herculean effort.

Within a framework of eight broad categories, the case studies explore state fragility, ethno-religious conflict, food insecurity, violent extremism, maritime piracy and extreme poverty as the primary drivers of regional insecurity. Methodologically, the research design is constrained by the lack of a structured case comparison. As a result, the work does not clearly advance a central thesis. A disciplined case selection -- guided by general investigative questions –- would more firmly anchor the evidence to an assumption that addressing Africa’s transnational threats are crucial to international security. 

Absent a conceptual model, readers must infer regional implications from myriad facts, figures and timelines. Readers must also assume that the evidence presented is most relevant to the cases at hand. Unfortunately, the results do not support a generalizable set of necessary and sufficient conditions valid across contingent cases. Emerging transnational threats require new modes of thinking -- focused on the ability of regional institutions, economic communities and African states to circumvent pitfalls on the path towards cooperation.
